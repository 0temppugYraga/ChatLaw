- Paper rollers: Check the paper rollers and make sure they are clean and not blocked by any foreign objects, such as paper jams or torn paper. Clean them with a soft cloth or cotton swab if needed.
- Ink cartridges: Check the ink cartridges and make sure they still contain enough ink, both color and black. Refill them if they are empty or low. Also check the hoses and make sure they are not folded or jammed.
- Vacuum tubes: Check the vacuum tubes and make sure they are clean and not clogged by any leftover ink. You can use a syringe or a suction tool to remove any ink from them.

By checking and fixing these parts, you can improve the performance of your Epson L1300 printer and prevent future errors.
