The album features guest appearances by Carlos Santana, Brandy, The Notorious B.I.G. and Slash. It also marks the reunion of Jackson with producer Rodney Jerkins, who had previously worked with him on Dangerous (1991). Invincible explores themes such as love, romance, isolation, media criticism, and social issues.
 
The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Jackson's vocals and some of the songs, but criticized its length, lack of innovation, and dated production. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 363,000 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments of one million copies in the US.
 
Invincible spawned three singles: "You Rock My World", "Cry" and "Butterflies". The first two reached the top ten in several countries, while the latter was released only in the US. The album also generated controversy due to a dispute between Jackson and his record label over promotion and royalties. Jackson accused the label of sabotaging the album and launched a campaign to boycott Sony Music.

Invincible consists of 16 tracks, with a total running time of 77 minutes. The album is divided into two discs: the first disc contains 10 songs, while the second disc contains six songs. The album cover features a close-up of Jackson's face, with his eyes covered by a silver band. The cover was designed by Jackson himself, who wanted to convey a sense of mystery and invincibility.
 
The album opens with "Unbreakable", a fast-paced song that features a rap verse by The Notorious B.I.G., who died in 1997. The song is a defiant statement of Jackson's resilience and strength in the face of adversity. The song also samples a vocal loop from "We Are the Champions" by Queen.
 
The second track is "Heartbreaker", a dance-pop song that features a rap by Fats, one of Jackson's collaborators. The song is about a woman who cheats on Jackson and breaks his heart. The song also contains references to Jackson's previous songs, such as "Billie Jean" and "Smooth Criminal".
 
The third track is "Invincible", the title track and one of the most experimental songs on the album. It is a dark and atmospheric song that blends elements of rock, industrial, and electronic music. The song is about Jackson's determination to overcome any obstacle and achieve his goals. The song also features guitar work by Slash, who had previously worked with Jackson on Dangerous.
 
The fourth track is "Break of Dawn", a smooth and sensual R&B ballad that showcases Jackson's falsetto vocals. The song is about a romantic night with a lover, and the desire to make it last forever. The song also features backing vocals by Dr. Freeze, who co-wrote and co-produced the song.
 
The fifth track is "Heaven Can Wait", another R&B ballad that expresses Jackson's devotion to his lover. The song is about Jackson's willingness to die for his lover, and his belief that heaven can wait until they are together. The song also features backing vocals by Boyz II Men, who had previously collaborated with Jackson on HIStory.
