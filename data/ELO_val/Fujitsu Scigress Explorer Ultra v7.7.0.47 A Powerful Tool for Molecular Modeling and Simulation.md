In this article, we will show you some examples of how to use Fujitsu Scigress Explorer Ultra v7.7.0.47 to perform some common image processing and analysis tasks. We will use some sample images that are included in the program or available online.
 
## Cropping and Resizing Images
 
Cropping and resizing images are basic operations that allow you to remove unwanted parts of an image or change its dimensions. To crop an image, you can use the Crop tool from the toolbar or the Edit menu. You can drag the handles of the crop rectangle to adjust the area you want to keep and press Enter to apply the crop. You can also specify the exact width and height of the crop area in the Options panel. To resize an image, you can use the Resize tool from the toolbar or the Edit menu. You can enter the desired width and height of the new image in the Options panel and choose a resampling method to preserve the image quality. You can also check the Maintain Aspect Ratio option to keep the original proportions of the image.
 
## Rotating and Flipping Images
 
Rotating and flipping images are useful operations that allow you to change the orientation of an image or create mirror effects. To rotate an image, you can use the Rotate tool from the toolbar or the Edit menu. You can enter the angle of rotation in degrees in the Options panel or use the slider to adjust it interactively. You can also choose a pivot point for the rotation from the drop-down list. To flip an image, you can use the Flip tool from the toolbar or the Edit menu. You can choose to flip an image horizontally or vertically from the Options panel.
 
## Filtering and Enhancing Images
 
Filtering and enhancing images are advanced operations that allow you to modify the appearance of an image or improve its quality. To filter an image, you can use one of the many filters available from the Filter menu. You can choose from categories such as Blur, Sharpen, Noise, Distort, Artistic, Color and others. Each filter has its own options that you can adjust in a dialog box or a preview window. To enhance an image, you can use one of the tools from the Enhance menu. You can adjust parameters such as brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma, exposure and others. Each tool has its own options that you can adjust in a dialog box or a preview window.
