# Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour by TheXsision: A Review
 
Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour is the expansion pack for the popular real-time strategy game Command & Conquer: Generals, released in 2003. It adds new units, structures, upgrades, and modes of play to the original game, making it more challenging and diverse. One of the most notable features of Zero Hour is the Generals Challenge mode, where the player can choose to play as one of nine unique generals, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and strategies. The player has to face off against the other eight generals in a series of missions, culminating in a final showdown with the ultimate enemy: General Leang, the boss general.

Zero Hour also introduces new weapons and technologies for each faction: the United States, China, and the Global Liberation Army (GLA). The US gains access to advanced air units such as the Specter Gunship and the King Raptor, as well as laser and microwave weapons. China can deploy internet hackers, nuclear tanks, and satellite strikes. The GLA can use combat cycles, toxin tractors, and sneak attacks. Each faction also has three sub-factions that specialize in different aspects of warfare, such as stealth, infantry, or superweapons.
 
One of the most popular ways to enjoy Zero Hour is by playing online with other players via C&C Online, a community-made server that allows multiplayer matches and co-op missions. To play online, players need to have GenTool installed, which is a mod that enhances the game's performance and features. GenTool also enables borderless fullscreen mode, widescreen support, anti-cheat measures, and more.
