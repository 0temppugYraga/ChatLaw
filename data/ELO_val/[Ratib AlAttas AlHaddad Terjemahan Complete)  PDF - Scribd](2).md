Ratib Al Attas is a valuable source of spiritual guidance and inspiration for Muslims who want to increase their love and remembrance of Allah and His Messenger. It is a book that has been passed down for centuries and has enriched the lives of many believers.
  
One of the distinctive features of Ratib Al Attas is that it contains some verses that are not found in the Quran or the hadiths, but are attributed to some of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad or some of the early saints. For example, one of the verses is: "O Allah, You are the One who has no partner, You are the One who has no equal, You are the One who has no rival, You are the One who has no helper, You are the One who has no need, You are the One who has no end, You are the One who has no beginning, You are the One who has no limit, You are the One who has no measure, You are the One who has no description, You are the One who has no comparison, You are the One who has no likeness, You are the One who has no similitude, You are the One who has no opposite, You are the One who has no defect, You are the One who has no change, You are the One who has no decrease, You are the One who has no increase, You are the One who has no death, You are the Living, the Self-Subsisting." This verse is said to be from Ali bin Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad.
 
Another feature of Ratib Al Attas is that it contains some verses that have different readings or interpretations from the standard versions of the Quran or the hadiths. For example, one of the verses is: "And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a mercy to all the worlds." This verse is from the Quran (21:107), but in Ratib Al Attas it is read as: "And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a mercy to all creation." This reading is based on a narration from Ibn Abbas, a cousin and companion of the Prophet Muhammad.
 
These features of Ratib Al Attas show that it is not a mere collection of verses from the Quran and the hadiths, but a reflection of the spiritual insights and experiences of its author and his sources. It is a book that expresses the love and devotion of al-Habib Umar bin Abdurrahman al-Athos and his predecessors to Allah and His Messenger. It is a book that invites its readers to join them in their journey of faith and worship.
