Wi-Fi site surveys are essential for designing, validating and troubleshooting wireless networks. They help you to ensure optimal coverage, performance and security for your Wi-Fi users and devices. But how can you perform a reliable Wi-Fi site survey that gives you accurate and actionable data?
 
One of the best tools for Wi-Fi site surveys is Ekahau[^1^], a professional-grade Wi-Fi design and spectrum analysis solution that works with iOS and Android devices. Ekahau allows you to perform fast and easy site surveys with its mobile app, Ekahau Survey[^2^], and its dedicated Wi-Fi measurement device, Ekahau Sidekick 2[^1^].

In this article, we will show you how to use Ekahau to perform a reliable Wi-Fi site survey in three simple steps:
 
1. Prepare your project and floor plan
2. Walk the site with Ekahau Survey and Sidekick 2
3. Analyze and report your results

## Step 1: Prepare your project and floor plan
 
Before you start your site survey, you need to create a project in Ekahau AI Pro[^1^], the powerful Wi-Fi planning and AI design software that works with Ekahau Survey and Sidekick 2. You can import your floor plan into Ekahau AI Pro and set the scale, orientation and wall materials. You can also define your Wi-Fi requirements, such as coverage areas, capacity, applications and security.
 
Ekahau AI Pro will then use its advanced algorithms to create a predictive Wi-Fi design for your network, showing you where to place and configure your access points (APs) for optimal performance. You can also use Ekahau AI Pro to simulate different scenarios, such as adding more users or devices, changing AP models or settings, or introducing interference sources.
 
Once you have your project ready, you can sync it to Ekahau Cloud[^1^], a secure online platform that allows you to collaborate across teams and work concurrently on the same project. You can then access your project from your iOS or Android device using Ekahau Survey.

## Step 2: Walk the site with Ekahau Survey and Sidekick 2
 
Now that you have your project on your mobile device, you can start your site survey. All you need is your iOS or Android device and Ekahau Sidekick 2[^1^], the fastest and most precise Wi-Fi testing and measurement device on the market. Ekahau Sidekick 2 connects wirelessly to your mobile device and collects all the Wi-Fi data you need for your site survey.
 
Ekahau Survey has two modes for site surveys: Autopilot Survey[^2^] and Manual Survey[^3^]. Autopilot Survey is an intuitive and innovative feature that tracks your path automatically using Apple ARKit and LiDAR technology. You just need to walk around the site while holding your device in front of you, and Ekahau Survey will record 30 measurements per second at every step. You don't need to click on the map or calibrate your location manually.
 
Manual Survey is a traditional way of performing site surveys, where you need to click on the map every time you stop at a location. You can use Manual Survey if you prefer more control over your survey path or if you are using an Android device that does not support Autopilot Survey.
 
As you walk the site with Ekahau Survey and Sidekick 2, you can see real-time heatmaps of various Wi-Fi metrics, such as signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), data rate, channel overlap and more. You can also view scan details on your survey path[^2^] to analyze the spectrum and better understand your RF environment. You can switch between different metrics, frequency bands and SSIDs easily.
 
Additionally, you can use the camera built into your device to take photos of installed APs or potential issues while you survey. You can also add notes on the go so you never miss a detail. All these annotations will be synced to Ekahau Cloud[^1^] and available for reporting later.
