## Steinberg Nuendo 6 Features: What Makes It Stand Out
 
Steinberg Nuendo 6 is not just a DAW, but a premium media production system that offers a comprehensive set of features for various audio applications. Whether you are working on film, TV, game, or VR projects, Nuendo 6 has something for you. Here are some of the features that make Nuendo 6 stand out from other DAWs:
 
- **ADM Authoring for Dolby AtmosÂ®:** Nuendo 6 supports the Audio Definition Model (ADM) format for creating immersive audio content in Dolby AtmosÂ®. You can configure objects and beds from existing tracks in the project, and use the included Dolby Atmos VST renderer to monitor, downmix, and export your mix in ADM BWF files.
- **Automated Dialog Replacement (ADR) system:** Nuendo 6 provides a fully-equipped solution for convenient recording of dialog and Foley. You can use up to 32 marker tracks with dedicated dialog events, import scripts in various formats, create take lists, and record multiple actors at once with the integrated video player.
- **Field Recorder Audio Import:** This powerful feature allows you to search for field recorder audio files matching selected events in the project. You can use metadata criteria to find the best candidates, preview them in sync with the project, and import them to new or existing tracks.
- **Game Audio Connect:** This feature allows you to transfer audio files directly from Nuendo to Audiokinetic WwiseÂ®, one of the most popular game audio middleware solutions. You can also recall Nuendo projects from Wwise segments, or create Nuendo projects from Wwise segments.
- **Ambisonics support:** Nuendo 6 supports Ambisonics, a technology that creates a spherical sound field for VR and 360Â° video applications. You can route mono, stereo, or surround channels to Ambisonics busses with the new VST MultiPanner plug-in, and monitor the Ambisonics mix with the VST AmbiDecoder plug-in.
- **Immerse with VST AmbiDecoder support:** Nuendo 6 supports Immerse with VST AmbiDecoder, an immersive 3D audio production tool developed by Dear Reality. This tool uses artificial intelligence to create realistic sound environments based on your individual hearing profile and head anatomy.
- **AAF support:** Nuendo 6 supports Advanced Authoring Format (AAF), a platform-independent file format intended for the transfer of media projects between different applications. You can import and export AAF files with embedded media or references, and preserve track layouts, edits, fades, automation, and more.
- **Next-generation audio engine:** Nuendo 6 features a crystal-clear, 64-bit floating-point audio engine that delivers up to 384 kHz sample rate, 5.1 surround support, flexible routing, full automatic delay compensation, and unlimited audio, instrument, and MIDI tracks.
