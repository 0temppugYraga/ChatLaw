If you are still not convinced that cracking Zoom Search Engine 7 is a bad idea, here are some testimonials from real users who regretted their decision:

> "I downloaded a crack for Zoom Search Engine 7 from a torrent site and installed it on my website. It seemed to work fine at first, but then I noticed that my website was loading very slowly and sometimes crashing. I checked the source code and found out that the crack had inserted some malicious scripts that were redirecting my visitors to spammy sites and stealing their information. I had to delete the crack and reinstall Zoom Search Engine 7 from scratch. It was a nightmare."

> "I used a keygen to generate a license key for Zoom Search Engine 7 and activated it on my computer. It worked well for a few days, but then I started getting error messages and pop-ups saying that my license was invalid and that I had to buy a new one. I ignored them, but then one day I couldn't open Zoom Search Engine 7 at all. It said that my license had expired and that I had to contact the support team. I was too embarrassed to do that, so I just gave up on Zoom Search Engine 7."
