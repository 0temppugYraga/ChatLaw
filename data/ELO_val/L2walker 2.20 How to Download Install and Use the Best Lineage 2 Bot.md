## What is L2Walker?
 
L2Walker is a bot program that can perform various actions in Lineage 2 automatically. It can follow a predefined path, kill monsters, loot items, use skills, chat with other players, and more. L2Walker can run in the background while you do other things on your computer, or you can watch it play on your screen.
 
L2Walker is designed to make your gaming experience easier and more enjoyable. It can help you level up faster, farm more items, complete quests, and earn more adena. It can also save you time and energy by doing the boring and repetitive tasks for you.
 
However, L2Walker is not a cheat or a hack. It does not modify the game files or interfere with the game server. It simply simulates your keyboard and mouse inputs based on the settings you choose. Therefore, L2Walker is not illegal or unethical to use, as long as you follow the rules of the game and respect other players.
