2. Mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO. This will create a virtual CD-ROM drive on your computer that contains the game files.
3. Run the setup.exe file from the virtual drive and follow the installation instructions. You may need to enter a serial number, which you can find on the [My Abandonware](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/snap-on-presents-gearhead-garage-the-virtual-mechanic-49v) page for the game.
4. To fix the compatibility issues with Windows 7, you need to replace the d3d.vd file from the Data folder of Gearhead Garage with the same file from another game called Nelson Piquet's Grand Prix. You can download this game from [My Abandonware](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/nelson-piquets-grand-prix-evolution-3xk) as well. This will prevent the game from crashing when you start it.
