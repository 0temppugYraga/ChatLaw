However, the film also faced some controversies and challenges. The film was initially given an A certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), which meant that it could only be shown to adults. The CBFC also asked for several cuts and modifications in the film, such as muting some swear words, blurring some images, and removing a kiss scene between two women[^3^]. The filmmakers protested against this censorship and appealed to the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT), which reduced some of the cuts and gave the film a UA certificate, which meant that it could be shown to children under parental guidance[^3^].
